## Description

The main goal of this project was to make the Horiseon website more accessible by refractoring its code inline with the accessibility criteria shared by the client. 

### How was this achieved?

- Improved the accessibility of images by adding alt attributes to the images
- Replaced HTML elements with semantic HTML elements
- Fixed nav link bug so that it scrolled to the appropriate section of the page
- Corrected the indentations within the html file to improve readability for future developes
- Consolidated html classes where appropriate to ensure that the next developer can read the code easily
- Added comments to the html and css files for the above reason
- Updated the title of the webpage for SEO purposes
- Adapted the structure of the css and html files so that they flowed in a logical order
